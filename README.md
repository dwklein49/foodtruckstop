FoodTruckStop

This is a web app designed to help food trucks reach out to more customers, especially in metro areas with rapid transit (i.e. subway lines).

FoodTruckStop will ask Food Truck Operators to disclose their loations on a daily basis via email and update those locations on a map. Aside from their location and the hours they will be at that location, participating food trucks will have other information shown, such as but not limited to, type of food, sample menu item, avg menu item price range (i.e. $5-$10, $10-$15), a link to their menu and/or twitter handle, etc.

All users will have access to the map of food trucks.

Patrons will have access to more features, such as a rating/recommendation icon, the ability to "favorite" trucks, and receive an email when their favorite trucks are in the area and other trucks that are in the area (this will be listed in order of raitings/recommendations).
